# A dual network visualization of the actors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (movies only). 

The original data table of actors x movies for these visualizations and analyses can be found [here](./Data/MovieMat/movie.mat.rda) where network data can be found [here](./Data/ForAnalyses/).

Actors were clustered (before the visualization) via hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage of a 0/1 dissimilarity matrix. The upper triangle shows connected (purple) vs. not connected (green). The lower triangle shows the strength of connectedness (not connected is white; more connected is darker).
