# A dual network visualization of the actors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (movies only). 

Actors are clustered via hierarchical clustering of a 0/1 dissimilarity matrix. The upper triangle shows connected (purple) vs. not connected (green). The lower triangle shows the strength of connectedness (not connected is white; more connected is darker).
